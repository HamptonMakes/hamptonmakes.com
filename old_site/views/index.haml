    %h2 Podcasts
    Also, checkout the podcast I do. It's called
    = link_to "We Have a Microphone", "http://www.wehaveamicrophone.com"
    and it's a fun, nerdy romp with a few cocktails involved.

%h2 Books

%p
  My most recent book is
  %a{href: "http://www.responsivewebdesignforteams.com/"} Responsive Web Design For Teams
  which is about how company teams can work together, using Sass, to build awesome
  responsive sites. It's a collaboration between myself and my husband, Michael Catlin.

%a{href: "http://pragprog.com/book/pg_sass/pragmatic-guide-to-sass"}
  %img.book{src: "http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/272/pg_sass_xlargecover.jpg"}

%p
  We also co-wrote
  %a{href: "http://pragprog.com/book/pg_sass/pragmatic-guide-to-sass"} Pragmatic Guide to Sass
  \. I was super honored to get to A) write a book with my husband,
  B) write about a technology I invented, and C) got to get published by
  my favorite publishing house! What an honor!
%p
  My first book was co-authored primarily with Jeff Hardy and was called
  %a{href: "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590596862?ie=UTF8&tag=justasloud-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590596862"} "Beginning Rails: From Novice to Professional"
  , but I haven't been involved with later editions. And truth be told,
  officially I was only a contributing author (who just worked a lot).
